Minification is the process of reducing the size of files by removing unnecessary characters such as whitespace, comments, and formatting, without changing their functionality.


Original HTML:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <!-- This is a comment -->
    <p>This is some text.</p>
</body>
</html>

Minified HTML:
<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Example Page</title></head><body><h1>Welcome to my website!</h1><p>This is some text.</p></body></html>

Same applies for CSS.
