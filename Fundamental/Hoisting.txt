Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase before the code is executed. 
Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their function scope or global scope, while function declarations are hoisted with their full function body. 
This allows variables and functions to be accessed before they are declared in the code.
