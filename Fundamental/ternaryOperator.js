/* Ternary operator
The ternary operator is a compact way to express conditional statements.
It generally follows the pattern:

var result = condition ? expression1 : expression 2;

condition - this is the expression that evaluates to either true or false
expression1 - this is the value or expression returned if true
expression 2 - this is the value or expression returned if the condition is false

var age = 20;
var message = (age >= 18) ? "You are an adult" : "You are not an adult";


var name = "Joe";
var message2 = (name === "Joe") ? "You are Joe!" : "You are not Joe!";

var name = "Elena";
var message3 = (name === "Elena") ? "You are Elena" : "You are not Elena";


var name = "Phil";
var message4 = (name === "Phil") ? "You are phil" : "You are not phil";
