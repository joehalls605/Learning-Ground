/*
 A 2D array, like a spreadsheet, expands this to having rows and columns, allowing you to organize items in a grid.

A 3D array takes this one step further. Instead of just a flat grid, imagine a box of these grids stacked on top of each other.  
This box has three dimensions:

Depth: The number of grids (layers) in the box.
Height: The number of rows in each grid.
Width: The number of columns in each grid.
