Synchronous vs. Asynchronous:

Synchronous:

Synchronous operations happen one after the other in a sequential order. Each operation must complete before the next one starts.
It's like following a recipe step by step – you complete one step before moving on to the next.
Asynchronous:

Asynchronous operations can overlap or happen independently of each other. One operation doesn't necessarily wait for the previous one to complete.
It's like cooking multiple dishes at the same time – you can work on one while another is baking in the oven.
