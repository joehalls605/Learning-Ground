Interpolate values refers to the process of embedding or inserting values (such as variables or expressions) directly into a string, typically to make the string more dynamic or personalized.

In JavaScript, interpolation is most commonly done using template literals (backticks `) which allow you to include variables or expressions inside a string without concatenating them manually.

let name = "Alice";
let age = 25;

// Interpolating values inside a template literal
let message = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;

console.log(message);  // Output: "Hello, my name is Alice and I am 25 years old."
