/*
A constructor in programming is a special type of method or function that is automatically called when an object is created or instantiated from a class. 
Its primary purpose is to initialize the object's state, which typically means setting initial values for the object's attributes or properties.

In JavaScript, a constructor method is a special method that is automatically called when an object is instantiated from a class. 
Unlike some other object-oriented languages where constructors are explicitly named after the class and have a predefined syntax, JavaScript constructors are defined using a function that belongs to the class.
